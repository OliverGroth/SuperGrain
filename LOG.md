 Literature review:
        Started reading through the literature and figured out how to get the data. 02/11
Github:
        Setup working github repository 01/11
Data:
        Recieved data and processed it for compatability from supervisor Filip Thor. 08/11
Synthetic Data
        Working python code to segment, rotate and create artificial data to expand training data 
        for deep learning methods. 21/11
        Needs improving so that rotations don't decrease the resolution of the image and make sure no white borders/anti-aliasing are introduced which could impact the classification leading to a train/test discrepancy in performance. 21/11
Deep learning environment:
        Tried implementing the tensorflow environment from "Learning from Synthetic Dataset for Crop Seed Instance Segmentation" by Y. Toda. via https://github.com/totti0223/crop_seed_instance_segmentation .
        Had hardware compatability issues but go it working with external datasets. 14/11
        Fixing tensorflow compatability 22/11
